## Frameworks and Language Used

- **Java**: The primary programming language used for developing the application.
- **Spring Boot**: A framework built on top of the Spring framework, providing rapid application development features for creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.
- **MySQL**: A popular relational database management system used for storing and managing employee address data.
- **Swagger UI**: An open-source tool that generates a user-friendly interface for interacting with the API endpoints.

## Dataflow

The employee address management system follows the following data flow:

1. **Client Interaction**: The client, such as a web browser or a mobile app, sends HTTP requests to the server for employee address management operations, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting employee addresses (CRUD operations).

2. **Controller Layer**: In the Spring Boot application, the incoming HTTP requests are handled by the Controller layer. The Controller receives the requests and delegates them to the appropriate methods in the service layer.

3. **Service Layer**: The Service layer contains the business logic of the application and handles employee address management operations. When a request is received from the Controller, the Service layer performs the necessary actions. For example, when creating a new employee address, the Service layer validates the input data, interacts with the data access layer, and performs any required transformations or calculations.

4. **Data Access Layer**: The Data Access layer is responsible for interacting with the MySQL database to perform CRUD operations on the employee address data. It uses SQL queries to retrieve, update, insert, or delete data from the database.

5. **Database**: The MySQL database stores the employee address data, including attributes such as employee ID, address, city, state, and postal code.

6. **Response**: After the data operation is completed, the response flows back through the layers in the reverse order. The Service layer receives the response from the Data Access layer, performs any necessary post-processing or formatting, and sends it back to the Controller.

7. **Controller Response**: The Controller layer receives the response from the Service layer and returns an appropriate HTTP response to the client, indicating the success or failure of the requested operation.

## Data Structure

1. **Employee Address Model**: The Employee Address model represents the data structure for storing employee address information. It typically includes attributes such as employeeId, address, city, state, and postalCode.

## Project Summary

The Employee Address Management system is designed to manage and perform CRUD operations on employee address data. It provides a RESTful API for interacting with employee addresses. The application is built using Spring Boot and uses MySQL as the database for storing employee address information. The API endpoints can be explored and tested using Swagger UI.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Java, Maven, and MySQL installed.
3. Set up the database configuration in the application.properties file.
4. Run the application using Maven or your preferred IDE.
5. Access the API endpoints using Swagger UI by navigating to the appropriate URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`).

## Database

The Employee Address Management system uses MySQL as the database to store employee address data. You need to create a MySQL database and configure the connection details in the application.properties file. The application will automatically create the necessary tables based on the defined data structure.
